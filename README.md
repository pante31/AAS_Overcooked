# Mini-project: _Overcooked_
Project for the exam "_Autonomous and Adaptive Systems_" based on the **_Overcooked_** environment.

## _Overcooked_
_Overcooked_ is a benchmark for **fully cooperative multi-agent systems**.
It is commonly used to test out the robustness of **collaborative agents**, but
can also serves to evaluate the generalization abilities of **cooperative agents**.
The goal of the game is to deliver soups as fast as possible. Each soup
requires placing up to 3 ingredients in a pot, waiting for the soup to cook,
and then having an agent pick up the soup and delivering it.
 - **Reward** = Total number of soup delivered
